Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources and serves as an interface between software and hardware. Linux is renowned for its stability, security, and scalability, making it a popular choice for a wide range of computing devices, from servers and mainframes to desktop computers and embedded systems.

It's important to note that when people refer to "Linux," they often mean a complete operating system that includes not only the Linux kernel but also a variety of software and utilities from the GNU Project and other sources. This combination is commonly known as a Linux distribution, or "distro."

Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, Arch Linux, and many others. Each distribution may have its own package management system, desktop environment, and configuration tools, giving users flexibility in choosing an environment that suits their needs.

One notable feature of Linux is its open-source nature, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This has led to a large and active community of developers contributing to its development and improvement over the years. Linux is widely used in server environments, powering a significant portion of internet servers, and it's also a popular choice for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.
